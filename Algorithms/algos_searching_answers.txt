Short Answer
1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Answer: Let's say you are the new receptionist to a company. And you get a phone call and need to relay a message to a coworker named Devon (could be a boy's or a girl's name!). But you do not know any of your coworkers names yet and they all happen to be in a meeting sitting around a large table. So while trying not to interrupt the meeting or drawing attention to yourself, starting from one end of the table you have to ask each and every person quietly what their name is, moving down the line from person to person, until you find Devon.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Answer: Automatically what came to mind is the phone book and a dictionary. Both are sorted alphabetically and when searching for a particular name you naturally do the divide and conquer algorithm.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

Answer: 7 iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

Answer: 3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: It would have to be linear since binary searches rely on the collection being sorted first. However, if there's a million items you can bet I would try to sort it all first if I could so that I could do a binary search.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: Binary, of course! Because ain't nobody got time to look for a Devon amongst a million people.

Programming Assignment:
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

Answer:
let allTheWords = ["aardvark", "albatross","brouhaha","cockamamie", "gobbledygook", "lollygag", "malarkey", "shenanigan"];

function wordSearch(dictionary, word){
   let start = 0;
   let end = dictionary.length-1;

   while (start <= end){
      let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
       if (dictionary[mid] > word) {
        end = mid - 1;
     } else if (dictionary[mid] < word) {
        start = mid + 1;
     } else {
        return mid;
       }
      }
    return "Word not found";
}

console.log(wordSearch(allTheWords, "albatross"));  //returns 1
console.log(wordSearch(allTheWords, "cockamamie")); //returns 3
console.log(wordSearch(allTheWords, "shenanigan")); //returns 7


2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

Answer:
function goFish (troubling, goldfish) {
  var result = null, value;
  for(let i =0; i < troubling.length; i++) {
    value = troubling[i];
    if(value === goldfish) {
      result = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(goFish(fishes, "white-spotted")); //returns 5;
console.log(goFish(fishes, "purple")); //returns null;
