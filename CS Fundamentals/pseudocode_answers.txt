>Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Programmers may write pseudocode to help map out logically what they want to see happen in their functions. It's a great way to start writing functions because it helps you to brainstorm and organize your thoughts first, then all you have to do is add in the correct syntax later.

>If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: It will not run on your computer. It's meant for people, not computers, so your computer won't be able to process it.

>Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

>Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A: INPUT two numbers
IF first number is greater than second number
  PRINT first number
ELSE
  PRINT second number

>Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A: FOR LOOP. Number starts at 1. Ends at 100. Increment number by 1.
  PRINT number
   END FOR

>Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A: INPUT an object and an array
FOR LOOP. Start at zero in the array. End at array.length. Increment by 1.
IF array index is equal to object
RETURN true.
ELSE
RETURN false.
END FOR

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A: function findEntry(arr, obj) {
    for(var i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == obj)
          return true;
        }
          return false;
        }
