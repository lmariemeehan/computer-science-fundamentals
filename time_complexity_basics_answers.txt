1. What is time complexity and what is its relation to algorithms?

Answer: Time complexity is a function that estimates how long it will take for a program/algorithm to execute. Figuring out the time complexity is a good way to depict the efficiency of an algorithm.

2. What is runtime?

Answer: Very similar idea to time complexity except that it is talking about the physical (seconds/minutes) of time.

3. How is the runtime of an algorithm calculated?

Answer: By entering different input sizes and watching the physical length of time. You also have to consider the fact that one computer to the next can be different in terms of single versus multi processor, read/write speed to memory, and bit sizes.

4. Name the six types of algorithm growth rates we saw in this checkpoint and list them in order of most efficient to least efficient. Now Google another algorithmic growth rate not covered and place it in the correct spot in your list.

5. Choose one of the algorithmic growth rates from the last question and make a comparison to a real-life situation.

6. Determine the time complexity of the following snippet of code. It is commonly known as a linear search.

FUNCTION linearSearch(array, target)
 FOR each number in the array
   IF number = target THEN
     RETURN true
   END IF
 END FOR
 RETURN false
END FUNCTION

7. Determine the time complexity of the following snippet of code.

If you get stuck, read through the graphical representation section again.

FUNCTION foo(array)
 FOR each number in the array
   FOR each number in the array
     print "Hello"
   END FOR
 END FOR
END FUNCTION

8. Determine the time complexity of the following snippet of code. It is commonly known as the Fibonacci sequence.

FUNCTION fibonacci(number)
 IF number < 1 THEN
   ERROR
 ELSE IF number = 1 or 2 THEN
   RETURN 1
 ELSE
   CALL fibonacci WITH number - 2 RETURNING twoBack
   CALL fibonacci WITH number - 1 RETURNING oneBack
   RETURN twoBack + oneBack
 END IF
END FUNCTION

9. Out of the code snippets you just saw, which is the most time efficient?
