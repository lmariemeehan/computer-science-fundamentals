6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

  * If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!
  Answer: All my examples would deal with a database filled with homes available on the market..
  <                Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *less than* a certain square footage.
  >                Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that have *more than* 3 bedrooms.
  =                Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are located *equal* to this city.
  <=               Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *less than or equal to* this price.
  >=               Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *greater than or equal to* this price.
  <>               Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *not equal* to a townhouse.
  !=               Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *not equal* to a multi-family dwelling.
  LIKE             Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that say something *like* contemporary in the keywords field.

  Bonus Fun: Real world examples with logical operators:
  NOT              Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *not* short sales.
  OR               Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that say price reduced *or* fixer-uppers in a status column.
  AND              Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that have 4 bedrooms *and* 2.5 baths.
  BETWEEN          Example: I could use this if I wanted to pull all homes that are *between* 500000 and 600000 dollars.
